## About The Data Science Workshop
[The Data Science Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Workshop-learning-real-world-dp-1800566921/dp/1800566921/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1611065035&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800566927&utm_term=Data%20Science&utm_content=The%20Data%20Science%20Workshop) equips you with the basic skills you need to start working on a variety of data science projects. Youâ€™ll work through the essential building blocks of a data science project gradually through the book, and then put all the pieces together to consolidate your knowledge and apply your learnings in the real world.	  

## What you will learn
* Explore the key differences between supervised learning and unsupervised learning 
* Manipulate and analyze data using scikit-learn and pandas libraries 
* Understand key concepts such as regression, classification, and clustering 
* Discover advanced techniques to improve the accuracy of your model 
* Understand how to speed up the process of adding new features 
* Simplify your machine learning workflow for production
